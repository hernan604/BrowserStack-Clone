Bot::Screenshot

This bots listen to 'session_start' queue.
When a new session gets created, it downloads the screenshot every 2 second's, untill the session is over. For at most 10minutes.

The bot will download each screenshot and will save into: public/v1/screenshots-live/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX.png   (session id)

This allows the site to show the updated screenshots
